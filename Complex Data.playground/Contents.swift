/*
 - Arrays must contain one data type, and can hold many values -- are read with indices
 - Dictionaries contain key pairs, can search via keys
 - Sets store many values, we dont choose the order
 - Enums create our own types, to specify acceptable values
 - By default, Swift utilizes type inference. We can however utilize type annotation to specify what we would like a variable/constant to be
 
 Looks like this was just a summary of the previous sections! Thanks for checking it out.
